    "## Crescendo attack as inspiration\n",
    "\n",
    "Microsoft released [a paper and adversarial approach](https://crescendo-the-multiturn-jailbreak.github.io/) for jailbreaking LLMs called Crescendo. In this approach, the attacker tries to generate increasingly adversarial prompts pointing the entire chat history/conversation slowly into what would before be banned content (i.e. illegal, explicit, harrassment/hate speech.)\n",
    "\n",
    "To automate this, the attack utilizes more than one LLM at once to steer the conversation towards some goal. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use this attack for feminism, we will adapt the type of goal and likely have to do much less effort, since hopefully feminism is not actually a banned topic in many LLMs. However, feel free to choose more sensitive topics related to feminism, such as reproductive rights, sex or safety. If so, you might need to invoke a third model to judge whether the attack has set off guardrails or not and to appropriately respond.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Setup one model as the model you want to attack. You can do that via HuggingFace/llamafile or via a model running on the LAN. \n",
    "2. Setup one model as the model that will help you attack the other model to produce increasingly more feminist responses. You can do that via HuggingFace/llamafile or via a model running on the LAN.\n",
    "3. (optional): if you need a model to review potential guardrails, you might want to try getting [LlamaGuard]() running. Note that this will require 10s of gigs of memory. (I know :()\n",
    "4. Start manually and guide one conversation to the next. One tip from the research is to have the helper model summarize the other model's response and then nudge toward the goal.\n",
    "5. If it works, you can try to see if there is an automatable attack template. Check out the research for the pseudocode/example.\n",
