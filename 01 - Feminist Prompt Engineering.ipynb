    "\n",
    "1. Ask the LLM to reword your prompt: You can put in an original prompt of what you want and request that the LLM rewords the prompt. This works because it will already activate the types of language an LLM might have already learned related to your task or the topic itself.\n",
    "2. Try using different synonyms or words to explain the topic more deeply or from multiple perspectives: Since LLMs work with a so-called context window, having more text related to what you'd like to talk about can help steer future responses.\n",
    "3. Take text you like on the topic and add it to your prompt: Similar to #2 this helps activate the correct embeddings/ideas in the model and potentially return a different response.\n",
    "4. Gather some ideas from prompt tuning by [reviewing leaked prompt instructions](https://github.com/linexjlin/GPTs). Given these instructions, what might you do to write feminist instructions?"
